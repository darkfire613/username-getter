Username Getter
===============

This program scans the usernames of new posts to a specified subreddit, then checks the usernames against a set of arbitrary rules. The purpose is to find a given account by the rules provided.

Note you will need the files specified in requirements.txt. Additionally, you will need to provide a list of subreddits to scan in a file named "sublist", one subreddit per line. Without this, the program will default to scanning /r/all.
